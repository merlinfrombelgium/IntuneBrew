## üîß Configuration

### Azure App Registration

1. Create a new App Registration in Azure
2. Add the following API permissions:
   - DeviceManagementApps.ReadWrite.All
3. Update the parameters in the script with your Azure details.
    - $appid = '<YourAppIdHere>' # App ID of the App Registration
    - $tenantid = '<YourTenantIdHere>' # Tenant ID of your EntraID
    - $certThumbprint = '<YourCertificateThumbprintHere>' # Thumbprint of the certificate associated with the App Registration

## ü§î Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Access Errors**
   - Ensure no other process is using the file
   - Try deleting temporary files manually
   - Restart the script

2. **Upload Failures**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify Azure AD permissions
   - Ensure file sizes don't exceed Intune limits

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify your Azure AD credentials
   - Check tenant ID configuration
   - Ensure required permissions are granted

## Certificate-Based Authentication Setup

IntuneBrew uses certificate-based authentication with Microsoft Graph API for enhanced security. Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

```powershell
# Generate a new self-signed certificate
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "CN=IntuneBrew" `
    -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
    -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
    -KeySpec Signature `
    -KeyLength 2048 `
    -KeyAlgorithm RSA `
    -HashAlgorithm SHA256 `
    -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(2) `
    -KeyUsageProperty Sign `
    -KeyUsage DigitalSignature `
    -Type SSLServerAuthentication

# Export the certificate for Azure AD
$certPath = "intunebrew.cer"
Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath $certPath -Type CERT

# Export the certificate in PEM format for the application
$pemPath = "intunebrew.pem"
$base64 = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.Export([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509ContentType]::Cert))
"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`n" + ($base64 -replace '.{64}', '$0`n') + "`n-----END CERTIFICATE-----" | Out-File -FilePath $pemPath -Encoding ASCII

Write-Host "Certificate thumbprint: $($cert.Thumbprint)"
```

### 2. Configure Azure AD App Registration

1. Create a new App Registration in Azure Portal
2. Navigate to "Certificates & secrets"
3. Upload the `.cer` file generated above
4. Add the required API permissions:
   - DeviceManagementApps.ReadWrite.All
5. Grant admin consent for the permissions

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```env
# Azure AD App Registration details
AZURE_APP_ID=your-app-id
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id

# Certificate configuration
AZURE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH=intunebrew.pem
```

### 4. Verify Certificate Setup

The application will automatically use certificate-based authentication when the environment variables are properly configured. The certificate will be used to obtain access tokens from Azure AD for Microsoft Graph API calls.
